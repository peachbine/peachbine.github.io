		<h1>Artist Statement</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>I am a designer in illustrator, currently in undergrad design program. The purpose for this current website is to fulfill the requirement for my final project for my intro to digital media class; which has introduced to new forms of art that I wasn’t aware of before. The main focus of my works was to essentially hone my skills in these new media and programs I was unfamiliar with such as video editing, 3d modeling, coding in html/javascript/css, and more that I could mention. With reading into more of the history of digital media and its other forms like glitch art, I’ve felt as if I’ve learned more than I originally expected to and that’s surprising.</p>
		<br></br>
		<p>With my goals and personal projects, some of the skills I’ve picked in this class with come in handy immensely throughout school and the future years to come. Not to mention, my outlook on how modern technology and media have and will affect us individually and as a society looms over my heads much more than before, but I remain to have a positive outlook on it all and will express these same sentiments in my future works.</p>
